# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, This is Jeacson who has undergraduated with a Bachelor of Engineering and a Bachelor of Science.

ðŸŒ± I'm motivated to become an engineer who knows a bit of everything whether it's hardware or software, front-end or back-end, mechanical assembly to board design, etc., I'm now doing my further education in Hongkong.

ðŸŽ¨ The name of my major in university is "Robotics and Intelligent Devices", which focuses on control courses related to robotics and embedded systems, but of course there are also many courses in the same subject as "Electronic Engineering". Attention: Individual universities may have different programmes for majors with the same name, so this is for reference only!

ðŸ’¬ Through self-study and university courses, I have learnt how to use computer languages such as JAVA/Python/JavaScript/HTML/CSS/C++/Objective-C to program on devices including, but not limited to, Raspberry Pi/ARDUINO/PCs.

ðŸ¤” I have a number of self-built websites (here's one of them, Although they were mainly written in Chinese):
    - Blog: it's *here*. Blog update time is not regular, update content including but not limited to: front and back-end related \ computer network related \ embedded related \ robotics related \ their own little whining \ and even a variety of their own interest but not very useful side knowledge.
    - Bobbing website: This project is a consolidated version of the old project `â€˜bobing-jettonmanâ€™`, adding relevant code on top of the original project to realise a pure front-end bobing version. You can access it by clicking [this link](https://bobing.jeacsonsnake.com/).
    - There should be other site outputs, but nothing inspired enough to put them aside at the moment.

ðŸ¤ª My Final Year Project was to implement a piano keyboard playing robot based on Raspberry Pi 5 by using the lightweight neural network MobilenetV3, you can see my description of it (if I remenbewr to wrote it down) on my blog.

ðŸ“« You can make a contact with me at <Jeacson_Snake@outlook.com> for anything I could help related to this website.
